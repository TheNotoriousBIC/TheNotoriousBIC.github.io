##Personal Broadcaster Website  
Here you'll find anything and everything related to me and my Twitch Channel!  

You can learn about who I am, and what kind of things I like to do when I'm not Broadcasting!  

One example of a great resource you'll find on my website, is a Calendar that is directly linked to my Broadcasting Schedule on Google Calendar. Whenever I add, remove, or update an upcoming broadcast, the changes are immediately reflected on that calendar, too! You can also watch my channel directly from the homepage!  

I've also included a table, filled with my favorite broadcasters to watch on Twitch! This table will tell you whether or not any of them are currently broadcasting. If so, all you have to do is hover your mouse over his/her profile picture, and you'll be able to watch him/her live!  

Finally, if for any reason you would like to Contact Me, you can do so directly from the site. Just fill out the form, and send it! It goes directly to my email's inbox, and I will do my best to respond in a timely manner!
